# WikiBot

## Purpose of the program
This scrapes data from the homepage of Wikipedia and posts it on Twitter.  I signed up for Wikipedia's mailing list and was disappointed 
when I was not sent the information from the "Did you know..." section, so I made this.  The posts can be found at 
https://twitter.com/WikiDailyFacts1 (@WikiDailyFacts1)

## Finishing the program
If you want to use this, you will have to create a Twitter Developer account and insert your private keys before being able to post.

# WikiComment

This searches Twitter for tweets that contain "what is," and replies with a completely random Wikipedia article.  I have RunComment.bat set to run every half hour.
